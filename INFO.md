Project Document: AI-Powered Personalized Learning MVP
This document outlines the vision, technical specifications, and a step-by-step setup guide for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of an AI-powered personalized learning platform using a Node.js-based technology stack.

1. Project Vision & Rationale
The core vision is to build a tool that addresses the significant bottleneck in self-learning: the time and effort required to curate learning materials and exercises. This MVP will serve as a proof of concept for a product that can instantly generate a personalized, structured course from existing web content, saving learners from the manual curation process.

This project is a high-potential venture in a rapidly growing market, with a clear differentiator: on-demand, hyper-specific content generation.

2. Core MVP Functionality
The MVP will focus on three main modules to demonstrate the core value proposition:

Web Scraping Engine: A backend service that takes a topic from the user and programmatically scrapes relevant articles and video links from the internet.

AI Processing Core: An AI model that takes the raw, unstructured scraped content and transforms it into a coherent, multi-module course outline.

Frontend Interface: A user-friendly website that displays the generated course in a clean, navigable format.

3. Technology Stack (Node.js Based)
This project will use a full-stack JavaScript environment for a unified development experience.

Backend: Node.js with the Express.js framework. This will handle the API endpoints for web scraping and AI processing.

Frontend: React for building a modular and responsive user interface.

Database: MongoDB for its flexible, NoSQL structure, which is ideal for storing the unstructured course data generated by the AI.

AI/ML Integration: API calls to a large language model (LLM) like Google's Gemini or OpenAI's GPT for content structuring.

Web Scraping: The 'google-it' package for search result acquisition.

Deployment: The project will be deployed on Vercel.

4. Step-by-Step Project Setup Guide
Follow these steps to set up the MVP project from the ground up.

Step 4.1: Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js and npm

MongoDB (local instance or a cloud-hosted MongoDB Atlas account)

A code editor (e.g., VS Code)

Step 4.2: Project Structure
Create a single main folder with two subfolders to keep your frontend and backend code separate:

your-project/
├── client/          # All React code will go here
├── server/          # All Node.js/Express code will go here

Step 4.3: Backend Setup (server folder)
Initialize Node.js Project: Navigate to the server folder and run npm init -y.

Install Dependencies: Install the necessary libraries using npm:

npm install express cheerio axios mongoose dotenv google-it

express: The web framework.

cheerio & axios: For web scraping.

mongoose: To interact with MongoDB.

dotenv: To securely manage API keys and connection strings.

Create Server File: Create an index.js file to serve as your server's entry point.

Database Connection: Use Mongoose to connect to your MongoDB database. Store your connection string in a .env file for security.

Step 4.4: Frontend Setup (client folder)
Create React App: Navigate back to the main project folder and use create-react-app to set up your frontend:

npx create-react-app client

Configure Proxy: To enable communication with the backend during development, open client/package.json and add the following line:

"proxy": "http://localhost:5000",

(Note: The port number 5000 should match your backend server's port.)

Step 4.5: Running the Project
Start the Backend: In the server directory, run node index.js.

Start the Frontend: In the client directory, run npm start.

Your browser will automatically open to http://localhost:3000, and the frontend will be able to successfully make API calls to your backend on localhost:5000.
